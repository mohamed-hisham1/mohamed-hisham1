**Aspiring Data Scientist | Building ML Solutions**  


---

## 👋 Overview

I'm a third-year computer science student passionate about using data to solve real problems. I have experience building machine learning models for classification tasks, analyzing datasets with Python and SQL, and creating data visualizations to communicate insights. I'm particularly interested in generative AI and how large language models are transforming how we interact with technology.
Currently, I'm diving deep into deep learning and LLMs, working on projects that explore their practical applications. I'm looking for data science internship opportunities where I can apply my skills and contribute to real-world AI solutions.
